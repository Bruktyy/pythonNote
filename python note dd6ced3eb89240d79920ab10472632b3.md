# What is Python?

Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 

It is used for:

- web development (server-side),
- software development,
- mathematics,
- system scripting.

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

# Execute Python Syntax

As we learned in the previous page, Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:

```python
>>> print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!

```

# Python Indentation

Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

```python
if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")
```

# Set

Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are [List](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp), [Tuple](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp), and [Dictionary](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp), all with different qualities and usage.

A set is a collection which is *unordered*, *unchangeable**, and *unindexed*.

- **Note:** Set *items* are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.

Sets are written with curly brackets.

```python
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print(thisset)
```

# Set Items

Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.

---

# Unordered

Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order.

Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.

---

# Unchangeable

Set items are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created.

Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can remove items and add new items.

---

# Duplicates Not Allowed

Sets cannot have two items with the same value.

```python
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple"}

print(thisset)
```

# Python Conditions and If statements

Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

- Equals: a == b
- Not Equals: a != b
- Less than: a < b
- Less than or equal to: a <= b
- Greater than: a > b
- Greater than or equal to: a >= b

These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.

```python
a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
```
